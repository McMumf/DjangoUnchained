# Django Unchained

This project is for me to learn the basics of Django

I am using the tutorial found from Django's [website](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)

## Setup

To setup the project clone the repo, then in the repo folder run `python3 manage.py migrate`

That will migrate all the imports and prevent any possible issues

To run the app, run `python3 manage.py runserver`
